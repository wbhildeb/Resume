%	INTRODUCTION
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% As a passionate programmer from a very early age, I have always enjoyed and prioritized taking on more responsibility than what is expected of me.
% In previous internships, my supervisors have acknowledged my ability to contribute to design meetings filled with more experienced developers, and to properly execute tasks assigned to me with minimal supervision.
% As a very quick learner, and a skilled developer, I'm able to work efficiently either independently or within a team to produce quality software.
