%	INTRODUCTION
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As a passionate programmer from a very early age, I have always enjoyed and prioritized taking on more responsibility than what is expected of me.
In previous internships, my supervisors have acknowledged my ability to contribute to design meetings filled with more experienced developers, and to properly execute tasks assigned to me with minimal supervision.
As a very quick learner, and a skilled developer, I'm able to work efficiently either independently or within a team to produce quality software.
