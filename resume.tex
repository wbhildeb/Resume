%	INTRODUCTION
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% As a passionate programmer from a very early age, I have always enjoyed and prioritized taking on more responsibility than what is expected of me.
% In previous internships, my supervisors have acknowledged my ability to contribute to design meetings filled with more experienced developers, and to properly execute tasks assigned to me with minimal supervision.
% As a very quick learner, and a skilled developer, I'm able to work efficiently either independently or within a team to produce quality software.

        {World leader in providing advanced geotechnical software to civil engineering and mining industries}
        {
            \item Created a CAD module to model the construction of complex 3D embankment loads and 
            conduct time-dependant vertical soil consolidation analysis using \textbf{C++}, \textbf{MFC} and \textbf{OpenGL}
            \item Developed algorithms to validate, discretize, and analyze the loads with a focus on time efficiency
            \item Improved accuracy of settlement analysis while connecting the CAD module to the engine
            \item Redesigned several geometric and mathematical tools with an efficient, \textbf{graph theory} based approach
